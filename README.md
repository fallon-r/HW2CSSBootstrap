# HW2CSSBootstrap

This is my new portfolio. The old one was janky, despite the dancing volleyball picture. 

1. My First move was to pull the HTML for the index from the card layout activity we worked on in class. My reasoning being that it had a chunk of what this assignment called for, like a nav bar and a few cards. I figured it would be a good base to make into what would ultimately be my completed About page. 
2. the Second move was to work on the Portfolio page. Putting the images into a grid was fun. It took some finagling to make them responsive. 
3. The third step was the Contact page. This page was a bit difficult.


I learned a lot about my approach through this assignment. One thing that drove me mad was the collapsible navbar. I spent many hours checking and rechecking my code, googling endlessly to figure out why it was not working. The hamburger icon was there, but why wouldn't it work?! At long last, I found that it would not function without the bootstrap JS script. This revelation came from the bootstrap documentation. I learned 3 important lessons from this. 

1. Don't spend too long on one problem. 
2. Read the documentation.
3. Seriously, read the documentation.
